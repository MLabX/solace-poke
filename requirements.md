# Project Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the Solace Message Sender Application. It serves as a reference for development and will be updated as requirements evolve.

## Functional Requirements

### Connection Management
- FR1: The application must allow users to specify Solace broker connection details (URL, VPN, username, password)
- FR2: The application must establish a connection to the specified Solace broker
- FR3: The application must provide feedback on connection status
- FR4: The application must handle connection errors gracefully

### Message Sending
- FR5: The application must support sending messages to both Queues and Topics
- FR6: The application must allow users to specify the destination name
- FR7: The application must allow users to input message payload as text or JSON
- FR8: The application must validate JSON payloads before sending
- FR9: The application must provide feedback on message send status
- FR10: The application must handle message sending errors gracefully

### User Interface
- FR11: The application must provide a form for entering connection details and message content
- FR12: The application must display success/error notifications
- FR13: The application must provide clear visual distinction between Queue and Topic destinations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- NFR1: The application must respond to user interactions within 500ms
- NFR2: The application must be able to send messages with payloads up to 1MB in size
- NFR3: The application must support multiple concurrent users

### Security
- NFR4: The application must not store sensitive connection details (passwords) in browser storage
- NFR5: The application must use secure connections (HTTPS/WSS) when available
- NFR6: The application must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks

### Usability
- NFR7: The application must be usable on desktop and mobile devices
- NFR8: The application must provide clear error messages that guide users toward resolution
- NFR9: The application must have a clean, intuitive interface

### Reliability
- NFR10: The application must gracefully handle network interruptions
- NFR11: The application must provide retry capabilities for failed operations
- NFR12: The application must log errors for troubleshooting
- NFR13: The application must handle port conflicts gracefully by automatically trying alternative ports

### Maintainability
- NFR14: The application code must follow consistent coding standards
- NFR15: The application must have clear separation of concerns (frontend/backend)
- NFR16: The application must include documentation for setup and usage

### Testing
- NFR17: The application must have comprehensive test coverage for both frontend and backend components
- NFR18: The application must include unit tests for validators and utility functions
- NFR19: The application must include integration tests for API endpoints
- NFR20: The application must include tests for error handling and edge cases
- NFR21: All backend Solace interactions in tests must be simulated using robust ESM mocking (no real broker required)
  - Tests must use Jest's `unstable_mockModule` to mock the Solace SDK, ensuring deterministic and reliable test outcomes.

## Future Requirements (Backlog)

### Authentication and Authorization
- FR-Future1: Implement user authentication system
- FR-Future2: Support role-based access control for different operations

### Enhanced Messaging Features
- FR-Future3: Support for message templates
- FR-Future4: Support for binary message payloads
- FR-Future5: Support for message headers and properties
- FR-Future6: Message history and persistence

### Monitoring and Analytics
- FR-Future7: Dashboard for connection statistics
- FR-Future8: Message delivery tracking and confirmation
- FR-Future9: Performance metrics visualization
